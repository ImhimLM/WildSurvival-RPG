# Wild Survival RPG
Wild Survival is a console-based Survival RPG game where you must survive and escape the island you're lost on!

## Installation Proccess
1. Install the latest version of [Wild Survival](https://github.com/ImhimLM/WildSurvival-RPG).
2. Unzip the file and **place the folder in your Desktop** (**IMPORTANT**)
3. Download Python 3.9 for your device. [Link](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/), to find the downloads section, scroll down to the bottom of the page and find "Files". Or you can use the following links: [Mac OS](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.0/python-3.9.0-macosx10.9.pkg), [Windows](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.0/python-3.9.0-amd64.exe).
4. Follow the instructions in the Python installer to download the app
5. Now open up terminal in the following ways:

On **Mac OS**, press âŒ˜ + Space, this will open Spotlight Search, then type "Terminal" and click the application that shows up.

On **Windows**, click the search bar at the bottom left corner of your Desktop, now search "Terminal" and click the application that shows up.

## Startup Proccess
1. Double-click the game folder on your Desktop (Just a reminder, the folder is called "WildSurvival")
2. Open "command.txt" and look for your OS type (There is only Mac OS and Windows). Under the name of the OS will be the command, that command is to run the game. On Mac OS, you will need to run a secondary command (optional) that will ask for your computer password because it will allow the shortcut file to run. The command is under "MacOS Terminal Permission Command". After inputting your Macbook password, it shouldn't result in anything, but now it has access to run the shortcut file.
3. If you are on Windows, it has the shortcut file too but no password is required to access it (Warning: The shortcut file has not been tested, so it may not work and only result in an error). To run the shortcut file on Mac OS, double-click the file named "MacOS.command", on Windows, double-click the file "Windows.bat" (Note: Upon double-clicking "Windows.bat" for the first time, it will ask you if you are sure to run the file, simply accept the request).
